                    Yes, I have a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Science (2025) and a
                    Bachelor of Science in Biology (2023). I don't use my biology degree at all anymore but I'd
                    love to incorporate it into the work that I do some day.

                    I work in IT, hence my silly name. It's alright, it pays the bills. But I'd really like to work in software
                    development some day.

                <div class="question">How long have you been coding for?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I taught myself the basics of programming about 15 years ago when I was in elementary school, but never
                    took it seriously until I started my CS degree in 2023. Since then I've learned a lot of CS
                    theory but still possess very few practical skills. I started documenting my journey learning web development
                    on this channel in January 2026.

                <div class="question">Why are you learning web development and not another kind of programming?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I feel like web development is a great spot to start for learning industry-relevant technologies.
                    It gives me a good foundation of knowledge that I can use to expand upon when the time comes.
                    Not to mention there are still more jobs requiring web development skills than any other kind of
                    software development (I think).

                <div class="question">Why aren't you using AI?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    I'm against leaning on AI for most things, <em>especially</em> learning. I want to learn things
                    the hard way so the knowledge I gain actually sticks. I don't want to have to rely on AI to do everything
                    for me; I want to deeply understand the technologies I'm learning and working with so I know what I'm doing.
                    I'm not against using AI forever, but not until I'm well-versed in these technologies. And even then I'd
                    probably just use it to generate boilerplate or basic layout patterns.
